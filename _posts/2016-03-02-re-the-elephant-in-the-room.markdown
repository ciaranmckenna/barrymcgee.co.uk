[Sarah Parameter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk) recently penned a blog post asking if work was drying up for freelancers working in the web industry.

It sparked quite a bit of engaging discussion and I also chipped in with my two pence.

In the spirit of [#indieweb](/development/2016/02/11/embracing-the-indieweb.html) and making sure I retain my own content for posterity, I'm reproducing my reply here.

To mark this reply up semantically using Microformats it seems I can use `rel="in-reply-to"` in a link anywhere on this page linking back to the original post like so;

{% highlight html %}
  <a href="http://..." rel="in-reply-to">Link to original post</a>
{% endhighlight %}

I like the idea of having a central place to reflect all my writing on the web, including comments in other places.

However, I think I'll limit it to comments of substance, might be a bit overkill for every ðŸ˜‚ on Facebook...

<blockquote class="blockquote--comment">

  <p>Iâ€™m not surprised the days of freelancers & small agencies living comfortably off high fidelity brochure/campaign sites are over.</p>

  <p>I know of London based agencies who, a couple of years ago, regularly pitched simple ~5 template brochure sites for Â£75,000. It was only a matter of time before businesses seriously looked at big outlays like that and considered their return.</p>

  <p>Itâ€™s simply makes more business sense to spend marketing/campaign capital on the walled gardens of social media where their customers already are than it does to launch a standalone campaign site for a limited period and face the uphill struggle of driving traffic to it.</p>

  <p>There has also been a lot of derision in the design community recent years about web design becoming homogeneous due to the rise of patterns & frameworks, like candlemakers complaining that bulbs provide light too consistently.</p>

  <p>Users donâ€™t want to relearn how to use the internet every time they visit a new site â€“ they want to complete a task at hand, quick and with as little friction as possible. Many businesses have realised you can get a very long way down the road simply using a framework out of the box.</p>

  <p>Another reality is that fixed price project model is badly busted and no longer works for clients or freelancers/agencies.</p>

  <p>The web is now mature enough that clients are fully clued in to whatâ€™s possible and they want it all while providers undercut and compete on price to win a declining pool of available work. The end result is projects that are over-promised, under-costed and ultimately over time not to mention all the pain that comes that relationship.</p>

  <p>However â€“ I see lots of reasons to be optimistic.</p>

  <p>While brochure sites may be declining , web apps are exploding. Strip back all the tools and frameworks and they all still boil down to the same three magic ingredients that weâ€™ve been crafting for the past 20 years â€“ HTML, CSS & JS.</p>

  <p>Put the time and effort in to skill up a little and youâ€™re using those same core skills to build native apps (using React Native for example)</p>

  <p>While work in traditional off-site freelancing is in decline , consider contracting â€“ embedding yourself within an in-house team for a set period. In-house teams will always have resourcing issues â€“ resulting in overspill.</p>

  <p>Many in-house teams also experience productivity/process issues and benefit from an outside perspective.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve been contracting for the past four years in London and work is everywhere.</p>

  <p>Sarah mentioned in her original post that things have changed significantly in the past three years â€“ I think we should always expect that in this industry. I donâ€™t expect my job as a Front End Developer to exist in ten years â€“ itâ€™ll have evolved into something completely different without doubt.</p>

  <p>In the big picture, the web industry is still in itâ€™s absolute infancy yet is irreversibly changing how the world lives â€“ itâ€™s inevitable that we stand on quicksand, the trick is to keep moving with it.</p>
