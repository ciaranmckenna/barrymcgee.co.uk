I recently had a chat with a colleague who confided that she felt she was drowning in her email account. I personally didn’t feel I had this problem and offered to help her out. After sitting with her for an hour and skimming through her inbox, we identified some key ways in which we could her help her so I thought these might be good to note down as they might help others.

\## Aggressively unsubscribe (unroll.me)

Every service you sign up to ask for your email address as it’s a wa as uniquely identifying you as you. This also gives every service a convenient way of contacting you, which few fail to exploit. By signing up to one mailing list, many people don’t realise they are often signing up to many mailing lists as large companies share lists between different products or services. You should selectively choose the messages you want to receive on a daily or weekly basis. If it’s nothing something that interests, excites or informs you, you should unsubscribe from that service.

\## Filter where possible

It may be possible you cannot unsubscribe to a particular service, either because that particular so unscrupulous/inept as to not provide an unsubscribe link or perhaps it’s an internal work tool that send out reports or alerts deemed by someone somewhere to be so important that the entire company must receive them. In this case, you shook filter them at source - i.e. using Gmail or Hotmail or whoever is the provider of your email account. This is preferable to configuring rules on your email as they are often dealt with before your email client can even retrieve them.

\## Be careful who you email

Emails are like loud noises in a cave - creating an initial email and sending to several people will more than likely result in multiple emails reverberating back to you. Only send emails to people who really need to read them. It can be tempting to copy in Tom, Dick and Harry with an ‘FYI’ but if it’s not critical that they read that email, don’t loop them in. You’re only clogging up their inbox and increasing the changes of “Thanks” emails which clog up your own in return.

\## Never reply all unless everything is on fire

Treat “Reply all” the same as standing up in your office and shouting a message at the top of your voice. Replying all should be used to convey message such as “Everything is on fire, run for your lives” - nothing less. Under no circumstances should you ever reply all asking everyone else to cease replying all.

\## Be terse

It’s fine to terse with emails. They don’t need to be bookedended with small talk for the sake of politeness. Keep them short and to the point. If you require a task to action - clearly outline what that is and what steps you expect to happen for it to be completed. Make it clear if you require a return email confirming receipt or if an action has been completed. Also make it clear if you don’t require a returning email.
