    <p><a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk">Sarah Parameter</a> recently penned a blog post asking if work was drying up for freelancers working in the web industry.</p>

<p>It sparked quite a bit of engaging discussion and I also chipped in with my two pence.</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="/development/2016/02/11/embracing-the-indieweb.html">#indieweb</a> and making sure I retain my own content for posterity, Iâ€™m reproducing my reply here.</p>

<p>To mark this reply up semantically using Microformats it seems I can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">rel="in-reply-to"</code> in a link anywhere on this page linking back to the original post like so;</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://..."</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"in-reply-to"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Link to original post<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I like the idea of having a central place to reflect all my writing on the web, including comments in other places.</p>

<p>However, I think Iâ€™ll limit it to comments of substance, might be a bit overkill for every ðŸ˜‚ on Facebookâ€¦</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote--comment">

  <p>Iâ€™m not surprised the days of freelancers &amp; small agencies living comfortably off high fidelity brochure/campaign sites are over.</p>

  <p>I know of London based agencies who, a couple of years ago, regularly pitched simple ~5 template brochure sites for Â£75,000. It was only a matter of time before businesses seriously looked at big outlays like that and considered their return.</p>

  <p>Itâ€™s simply makes more business sense to spend marketing/campaign capital on the walled gardens of social media where their customers already are than it does to launch a standalone campaign site for a limited period and face the uphill struggle of driving traffic to it.</p>

  <p>There has also been a lot of derision in the design community recent years about web design becoming homogeneous due to the rise of patterns &amp; frameworks, like candlemakers complaining that bulbs provide light too consistently.</p>

  <p>Users donâ€™t want to relearn how to use the internet every time they visit a new site â€“ they want to complete a task at hand, quick and with as little friction as possible. Many businesses have realised you can get a very long way down the road simply using a framework out of the box.</p>

  <p>Another reality is that fixed price project model is badly busted and no longer works for clients or freelancers/agencies.</p>

  <p>The web is now mature enough that clients are fully clued in to whatâ€™s possible and they want it all while providers undercut and compete on price to win a declining pool of available work. The end result is projects that are over-promised, under-costed and ultimately over time not to mention all the pain that comes that relationship.</p>

  <p>However â€“ I see lots of reasons to be optimistic.</p>

  <p>While brochure sites may be declining , web apps are exploding. Strip back all the tools and frameworks and they all still boil down to the same three magic ingredients that weâ€™ve been crafting for the past 20 years â€“ HTML, CSS &amp; JS.</p>

  <p>Put the time and effort in to skill up a little and youâ€™re using those same core skills to build native apps (using React Native for example)</p>

  <p>While work in traditional off-site freelancing is in decline , consider contracting â€“ embedding yourself within an in-house team for a set period. In-house teams will always have resourcing issues â€“ resulting in overspill.</p>

  <p>Many in-house teams also experience productivity/process issues and benefit from an outside perspective.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve been contracting for the past four years in London and work is everywhere.</p>

  <p>Sarah mentioned in her original post that things have changed significantly in the past three years â€“ I think we should always expect that in this industry. I donâ€™t expect my job as a Front End Developer to exist in ten years â€“ itâ€™ll have evolved into something completely different without doubt.</p>

  <p>In the big picture, the web industry is still in itâ€™s absolute infancy yet is irreversibly changing how the world lives â€“ itâ€™s inevitable that we stand on quicksand, the trick is to keep moving with it.</p>
