    <p>Growing up in Northern Ireland I was always told that when in polite company, never discuss religion or politics as it’ll likely end in a blazing row.</p>

<p>However, as the date of the EU referendum draws ever closer, I’m finding myself increasingly frustrated with narrative of public debate and the number of assertions that are seemingly allowed to go unchallenged.</p>

<p>Before going any further, I’ll lay my cards on the table — I’m a solid Remainian. At this moment however, I fear the Leave campaign will possibly prevail due to the success of the misinformation campaign they have waged for the past three months.</p>

<p>How did we get here in the first place? David Cameron thought he could shoot the UKIP fox by promising an EU referendum and removing the motivation to vote UKIP. Support for the EU wold be surely a shoo-in and that would also finally silence the rowdy Tory backbench.</p>

<p>This strategy has now spectacularly backfired on him as calling the referendum has only galvanised Eurosceptics across all parties and fired up a public still limping from the recession and eager to lash out.</p>

<p>Now, what started as an internal Tory party ruck has morphed into the biggest political choice of my lifetime, the UK sleepwalking towards the precipice and Downing St left wondering that the hell it was smoking when it promised the referendum.</p>

<p>Lets first address three main themes that have dominated the debate.</p>

<h2 id="immigration">Immigration</h2>

<p>The biggie. I’ve always thought that no matter what anyone else said, the issue of immigration would decide this referendum. Decrying immigration has been UKIP’s raison d’être from day dot and UKIP are the number one reason this referendum was called in the first place.</p>

<p>I get that there is a big problem in the UK with immigration, or at the very least, there’s a big problem with the perception of immigration. The common complaint is the immigrants are coming over here, taking our houses, taking our jobs, or if they’re not taking our jobs - they’re claiming benefits.</p>

<p>Official figures have repeatedly confirmed that immigrants are net contributors to the UK [1]. 91% of social housing goes to UK nationals [2]. 82% of non-UK nationals never use social housing in their lives. [2] Less than 3% of UK benefits is given to immigrants. [3] In truth, the squeeze in public services is not because of immigrants but under-funding and mismanagement by successive governments particularly exacerbated in recent years by acute austerity.</p>

<p>This perception and rage is compounded by a hysteric right wing media in the UK. The Sun &amp; The Daily Mail are the two most popular daily newspapers in the UK, with combined daily circulation of about 5 million.</p>

<p>Their typical gameplan involves screaming an outrage on the front page about the EU / Migrants / straight bananas before quietly admitting it was all horseshit in the corner of page 20 a couple of days later.</p>

<p>The problem is that people don’t want to hear any of that because at the root of their discontent is an emotional reaction to what they see as a loss of their culture and way of life.</p>

<p>During the 2010 General Election, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown crossed paths with local woman Gillian Duffy on the campaign trail in Rochdale. In nine schools across Rochdale, 70 per cent of the children speak English as a foreign language [4]. In a now (infamous exchange)[http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript], she dared complain about the effects of immigration on the local community and he called her a bigot once he was safely back in his ministerial car.</p>

<p>People don’t care about dry facts and figures about GDP etc when what used to be their local pub is now a Polish deli &amp; the local primary school they went to now has 25 distinct languages reverberating around the playground.</p>

<p>Failure of government to see this effect of an open-door EU policy on working-class communities and address it without insinuating that anyone complaining are racist or bigoted has created a festering rage that we now see boiling over.</p>

<p>This fear and perception is not just confined to places where immigration is high. It’s arguably more acutely felt in places where immigrants are rare but anecdotes are plentiful. It’s much easier to advocate kicking out all the immigrants when you don’t count any of them as friends or family.</p>

<blockquote>
My brother and sister have lived all their life in Devon and rarely encounter anyone who is foreign or even black. Consequently they are very pro-Leave.
</blockquote>

<p>The Leave campaign are insinuating Brexit will be the silver bullet to solve all immigration woes. It will not. Only about 50% of net migration last year was from within the EU. The other 50%, the UK already has full control over and still hasn’t reduced figures.</p>

<p>Put simply - leaving the EU will not fix the problems people have with immigration.</p>

<p>Finally, on this point - large scale immigration in the last two decades hasn’t been entirely due to EU membership. The internet has made the world a hell of a lot smaller not to mention cheap air travel. The natural outworkings of these changes is a more diverse mix in developed countries where opportunities are plentiful.</p>

<p>This is simply a fact of life and has been happening since long before the UK joined the EU - people who have limited opportunities where they are will gravitate to places where there are more opportunities, why do you think America is full of Irish?</p>

<p>The UK should embrace and shape these challenges rather than attempt to pull up the drawbridge.</p>

<h2 id="sovereignty">Sovereignty</h2>

<p>Much has been made of jingoistic Leave rhetoric of “Let’s make Britain Great again” and “Let’s take back control”. Joe Public is now parroting back these lines in full throated retorts on the evening news - but, what do they actually mean?</p>

<p>After 40 years of unfettered access to the world’s largest trading bloc, Britain is currently sitting as the fifth largest economy in the world. Crime is down. Unemployment is down. Household income up. Healthy life expectancy has soared. Air quality has vastly improved. Access to green and public spaces such as forestry has hugely increased. When exactly did Britain stop being Great? And more importantly, how exactly will leaving the EU make Britain greater? The Leave campaign is big on rhetoric but small on actual detail.</p>

<p>Taking back control is the other big call. Leave continually bang an angry drum about unelected EU bureaucrats but fail to acknowledge that the UK electorate (or any electorate for that matter) never really calls all the shots.</p>

<p>Sovereignty is not a baton to be passed back to the people on June 24th - it’s inherently multi-faceted and is diluted at every level in some way.</p>

<p>For example, The Minister for Defense of the day is a politician, not an Army General, and as such needs to rely on a huge team of unelected senior civil servants to make crucial decisions. This is true across all governments.</p>

<p>Only 24% of eligible voters in the UK voted Conservative in the last election and they now wield majority rule. On top of that, they appoint (not elect) the House of Lords which currently boasts over 700 members. Oh, and who sits on top of that pile? An hereditary monarch.</p>

<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>

<p>This is where the wheels really comes off the Leave cart. There is not a single reputable financial organisation that predicts that Brexit would be good for the UK economy.</p>

<p>The IMF (International Monetary Fund) has said Brexit could “entail sharp drops in equity and house prices, increased borrowing costs for households and businesses, and even a sudden stop of investment inflows into key sectors such as commercial real estate and finance. [5]”</p>

<p>The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has said Brexit “would be a major negative shock to the UK economy, with economic fallout in the rest of the OECD, particularly other European countries. In some respects, Brexit would be akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained in the EU. [6]”</p>

<p>The WTO (World Trade Organisation) head says leaving EU would cost UK consumers £9bn a year [7].</p>

<p>The UK Treasury long-term economic analysis of a British exit from the EU arrives at a central estimate that it would “ultimately lower UK economic output 6.2 per cent, amounting to an annual cost to British households of £4,300 a year” [8].</p>

<p>The most common response from Leave I’ve heard to these stats is that they’re “scare-mongering”, however Leave has not been able to rebuke them with any robust figures.</p>

<p>Nigel Farage has even admitted that a hit is inevitable but it’ll be a “price worth paying” for fewer immigrants [9].</p>

<p>I wonder how many will still be thinking about immigrants when they’re the guts of five grand worse off come end of next year? As a wise man in Belfast once said, you can’t eat a flag.</p>

<p>When it comes to Northern Ireland, the prospects are even more stark. As a small economy, sharing a land border with the EU - NI’s position is even more vulnerable. This has been echoed by many reputable voices over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Earlier this week the ex-head of the World Trade Organisation described Brexit an ‘act of wanton destruction’ for NI economy [10]. Dead hand on NI and prominent Leave campaigner Theresa Villiers dismissed this view as from a “so-called expert” - if the ex-Head of the World Trade Organisation is not an expert on global trade, who is?</p>
